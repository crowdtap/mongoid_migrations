Usage: ./script/generate mongoid_migration MigrationName [options]

Description:
    Stubs out a new Mongoid migration. Pass the migration name, either
    CamelCased or under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    A migration class is generated in db/mongoid_migrate prefixed by a timestamp of the current date and time.

    You can name your migration in either of these formats to generate add/remove
    column lines from supplied attributes: AddColumnsToTable or RemoveColumnsFromTable

Example:
    `./script/generate mongoid_migration AddSslFlag`

    If the current date is May 14, 2008 and the current time 09:09:12, this creates the AddSslFlag migration
    db/mongoid_migrate/20080514090912_add_ssl_flag.rb
